= Demo Leapp

We first need to make sure we've got the required repositories and requirements
for leapp to run.

[source,bash]
----
cd ansible

ansible-playbook  -i hosts setup-leapp.yaml 
----

We're then going to leverage a https://github.com/mrjoshuap/ansible-leapp[leapp role] from Ansible Galaxy
developed by one of the Red Hat team

[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy  install -r requirements.yaml

ansible-playbook  -i hosts run-leapp.yaml
----
