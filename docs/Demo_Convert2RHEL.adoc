= Demo Convert2RHEL

We're going to use an ansible playbook from the upstream project team to install
the core requirements for convert2rhel to run

[source,bash]
----
cd ansible

curl -L -O https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/raw/main/ansible/setup-convert2rhel.yml

ansible-playbook  -i hosts setup-convert2rhel.yml 
----


For the run portion we need to make sure we've got a valid Red Hat portal login in our secrets.yaml.

The actual run can take over 10 minutes depending on your connection and VM performance, and once completed 
the VM will be rebooted.

[source,bash]
----
curl -L -O https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/raw/main/ansible/run-convert2rhel.yml

ansible-playbook  -i hosts run-convert2rhel.yml --extra-vars "@secrets.yaml"

----

If you want to watch some of the update progress you can remote into the virtual machine and monitor the yum log

[source,bash]
----
ssh leapp2rhel

tail -f /var/log/yum.log
